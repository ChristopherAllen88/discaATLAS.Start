# discaATLAS.Start
This small project was implemented to create a dynamic JList that is going to communicate with mongoDB with functions like create
a list with values from mongoDB and save it back into mongoDB. The program is going to be configured, so it can edit a list, delete
values in a list, the list can be send and quantified. 

Working with MongoDB, Maven, Java and Springframe.
